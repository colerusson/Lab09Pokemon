# Lab09Pokemon
Lab in CS 235 in which we use hash maps and sets to populate and control Pokemon, moves, stats, and run battles.
Welcome to the world of Pokémon! In this world, you can use special creatures to battle against each other, and the trainer with the best strategy wins. In this lab you will implement a set and a map and then use them to create a Pokémon storage and battle system.
